    <h1>The back of the New $20</h1>
    
        <p>Have you seen the "Series 2004 $20 Notes"? The U.S. Treasury has rolled out yet another revamp of the U.S. twenty dollar bill in an effort to stop those pesky counterfeiters once and for all. It features high-tech fake-busting elements like a watermark, a security thread, and color-shifting ink. It also features crappy design.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not going to concern myself here with a critique of the front of the bill (my friend Jeff says "it looks like something got spilled on it."). It's the back of the note that's driving me crazy.</p>
        
        <h2>Too many 20's</h2>
        
        <img src= "twenties.jpg" alt= “$20” />
        
        <p>In particular, it's all those little 20s haphazardly sprinkled in the white space. They are nails-on-a-chalkboard to my visual design senses</p>
        
        <p>Are they supposed to be another security feature? ("They'll NEVER be able to duplicate this $20... look at those 20s... they're all OVER the place!") Did they let a summer intern at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing design it? ("Hey, let Jimmy try it!") Were they concerned the $20 bill might be confused with a $10? ("What this 20 needs is a LOT more 20s.")</p>
        
        <h2>Connect-the-Dots</h2>
        
        <p>There must be more to it. My theory: the new 20s contain subliminal connect-the-dots messages, like tiny constellations. So, perhaps the 20s connect to form a secret message designed to stimulate the economy ("SPEND MORE") or boost patriotism ("WE'RE NO.1").</p>
