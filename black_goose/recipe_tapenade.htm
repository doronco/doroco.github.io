<h3>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h3>
      </head>
    <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and its always a big hit at parties. My fathe recommends:</p>
          <blockquote>"Make this the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room tempature before you serve it. In the winter try serving it warm."</blockquote>
      
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

          <p><li>1 9oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 large garlic cloves</li>

            <li>1 t. capers</li></p> 
           
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <ul> 
                <li>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</li>
                <li>Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</li>
